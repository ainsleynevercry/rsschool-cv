                                <p>It is very gloomy. Isn't it?</p> 
                                <br>    
                                <p>Despite the fact that I am a creative person, I have a <em>technical</em> background. I showed interest in programming thanks to my father when I was searching for myself. I have been learning web programming on my own <strong><em>for only a month</em></strong>, but I have some small <em>positive</em> results. Programming is difficult, but interesting. <strong>I’m not afraid</strong> of complexity. So far I am not a cool specialist, but in the future I hope to achieve great success.</p>

                                <p>Or as a last resort:
                                    <br><br> 
                                    <q>I don’t understand anything! Okay, pretend I got it...</q></p>
