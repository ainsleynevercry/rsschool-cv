    <p>There are some of my art works:</p>

    <p>It is very gloomy. Isn't it?</p> 
    <br>    
    <p>Despite the fact that I am a creative person, I have a <em>technical</em> background. I showed interest in programming thanks to my father when I was searching for myself. I have been learning web programming on my own <strong><em>for only a month</em></strong>, but I have some small <em>positive</em> results. Programming is difficult, but interesting. <strong>I’m not afraid</strong> of complexity. So far I am not a cool specialist, but in the future I hope to achieve great success.</p>
    
    <p>As Naruto Uzumaki said: <q>Never give up... Get up when everything collapsed - this is real strength.</q></p>
    
    <p>Or as a last resort: <q>I don’t understand anything! Okay, pretend I got it...</q></p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have no experience as a developer yet. Now I study at epam courses and engaged in self-education.</p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Graduated from <em>Minsk State College of Architecture and Civil Engineering</em> with a degree in <em>engineering and architecture</em>. Graduated from <em>Adobe Illustrator</em> courses.</p>
    
    <h2>English</h2>
    <p>A test from the Internet says that I have an intermediate. But I think that my level is lower, because I understand well by ear, I can write simple sentences, but I slowly think and speak poorly.</p>
