## Summary
As Jason Statham said:
> When my mother gave birth to me, in fact, then I was born.

I do different types of creativity: drawing, writing, music. 

There are some of my art works:

It is very gloomy. Isn't it? <br>

Despite the fact that I am a creative person, I have a _technical_ background. I showed interest in programming thanks to my father when I was searching for myself. I have been learning web programming on my own _**for only a month**_, but I have some small _positive_ results. Programming is difficult, but interesting. **I’m not afraid** of complexity. So far I am not a cool specialist, but in the future I hope to achieve great success.
